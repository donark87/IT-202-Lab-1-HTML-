      <h3>Medieval India</h3>

      <p>The medieval period denotes a significant stage throughout the entire existence of India.
      The historical backdrop of medieval India starts with the Rajput Era and feudalism.
      During this period, Delhi was governed by lines like Khiljis. Afterward, Babur, who was the
      descendent of Timur came to India and built up the Mughal domain which later saw the ascent
      of incredible Mughal rulers including Akbar the Great, Jehangir and Shah Jahan. </p>

      <h3>Modern India History</h3>

      <p>Vasco da Gama when arrived at Calicut, cruising to the Cape of Good Hope in 1498, denoted the
          start of the European time in Indian history. The Portuguese by the sixteenth Century had effectively
          settled their territory in Goa.</p>

      <p>In the following century, India was visited by countless European explorers - Italians, Englishmen,
      Frenchmen, and Dutchmen. They were attracted to India for various reasons. Some were merchant, others
      explorers, and many terminated by the evangelist energy to discover changes over to Christianity.
      In the end, England, France, the Netherlands, and Denmark, glided East India Companies. </p>

      <p>During the late sixteenth and the seventeenth Centuries, these organizations contended with one
      another wildly. By the last quarter of the eighteenth century, the English had vanquished all others
      and built up themselves as the prevailing force in India. The British ruled India for a time of around
      two centuries and realized progressive changes in the social, political and the financial existence of
      the nation.</p>
